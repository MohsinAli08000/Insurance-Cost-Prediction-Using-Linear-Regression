# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using a real-world dataset with key features such as age, BMI, and number of children. It is part of my internship experience at **Rhombix Technologies**, aimed at building reliable predictive models in the healthcare domain.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a linear regression model that accurately estimates insurance charges based on personal and health-related factors. This involves thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to ensure robustness and reliability.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and detected outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve data quality.
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied `StandardScaler` to scale numeric features, enhancing model convergence and performance.
- **Data Splitting:** Divided the dataset into training and testing sets with an 80/20 ratio to validate the model.
- **Modeling:** Implemented Linear Regression to predict insurance costs.
- **Evaluation:** Used performance metrics such as RÂ² (coefficient of determination), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MSE (Mean Squared Error) to assess the model's accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Outcomes

- Strengthened skills in data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Gained practical experience in training and evaluating regression models.
- Developed a deeper understanding of predictive modeling in the healthcare analytics domain.
